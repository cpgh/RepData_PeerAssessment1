This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Read file and create df for histrogram without NA values:

```{r, echo=TRUE}



mydata <- read.csv("activity.csv")


## df with out NA values
mydata.1 <-mydata[complete.cases(mydata), ]



mydata.1.mean <- aggregate(mydata.1[ ,1], 
                                     by = mydata.1[c("date")], FUN=mean)



```

Create histrogram of mean number of steps/day:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
hist(mydata.1.mean[,2], col="orange", main="Histogram of Personal Activity Data",
          xlab = "Mean Number of Steps")

```
